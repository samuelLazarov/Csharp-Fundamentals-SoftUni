//You are an astronaut who just embarked on a mission across the solar system.
//Since you will be in space for a long time, you have packed a lot of food with you.
//Create a program, which helps you identify how much food you have left and gives you
//information about its expiration date.

//On the first line of the input, you will be given a text string. You must extract the
//information about the food and calculate the total calories. 

//First, you must extract the food info. It will always follow the same pattern rules:

//It will be surrounded by "|" or "#" (only one of the two) in the following pattern: 
//#{item name}#{expiration date}#{calories}#   or  |{item name}|{expiration date}|{calories}|

//The item name will contain only lowercase and uppercase letters and whitespace
//The expiration date will always follow the pattern: "{day}/{month}/{year}", where the day,
//month, and year will be exactly two digits long
//The calories will be an integer between 0-10000

//Calculate the total calories of all food items and then determine how many days you can last
//with the food you have. Keep in mind that you need 2000kcal a day.
